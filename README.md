This is my personal page. I figured out about that i could make pages hosted here in Github
and i began to build it to make this project real.

HTML5, CSS3, VainillaJS, Font Awesome, Google Fonts, my hands and imagination. Only these were the tecnologies that i used (My laptop with ubuntu, Google Chrome, Sublime too, of course)

This is just a personal page, portfolio and a sample of my skills. I hope you like.
